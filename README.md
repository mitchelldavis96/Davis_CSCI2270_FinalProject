Final Project

Summary:
For this project I will use huffman encoding to identify the frequency of characters and then convert them to huffman codes.
I will have a user enter in a sentence or a file and it will then convert.  I will use binary trees and priority queues to implement the compression algorithm.   I will store the code in a header file that will have a class declaring all of the functions, a function.cpp file, and then a main cpp file where everything is called.

How to Run:
download the directory that contains this header file.  bits/stdc++.h
using the main.cpp just enter in the characters and the frequency to get an example of huffman codes.

Dependencies:
https://gist.github.com/eduarc/6022859
download or include that file in your directory.

System Requirements:
an IDE, compiler, it will work on windows, OSX, and Linux.  Nothing else is required.
