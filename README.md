# Davis_CSCI2270_FinalProject
Final Project


For this project I will use huffman encoding to convert ASCII to binary to take up less memory.
I will have a user enter in a sentence or a file and it will then convert.  I will use binary trees and priority queues to implement the compression algorithm.   I will store the code in a header file that will have a class declaring all of the functions, a function.cpp file, and then a main cpp file where everything is called.
